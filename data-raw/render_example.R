## Render the starter template with the Quarto extension into a self-contained,
## full-fidelity FGCZ-styled HTML, and place it where pkgdown will publish it.
##
## Why not a vignette? pkgdown re-themes articles (theme: none + its own
## template, extracting only <main>), so a vignette cannot show the real FGCZ
## layout. A standalone render served as a pkgdown asset shows it unmodified.
##
##   Rscript data-raw/render_example.R
##
## Output: pkgdown/assets/example-report.html  (pkgdown copies assets/ into the
## built site, so it is served at <site>/example-report.html).
