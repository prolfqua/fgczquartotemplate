# fgczquartotemplate

Shared **Quarto report assets** for FGCZ analysis packages (`ezRun`,
`prolfqua`, …). It packages one common look-and-feel — a directory-level
`_metadata.yml`, an SCSS theme, and an HTML header — plus a starter
report template and small helpers to stage those files next to a `.qmd`
and render it.

The goal: keep the FGCZ report styling in **one place** so every package
that produces Quarto reports shares it and a theme change is a single
package bump.

## What’s inside

Installed under `inst/quarto/`:

| File                      | Role                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_metadata.yml`           | Shared format defaults. Quarto applies it **automatically** to every `.qmd` in its directory — reports need no reference to it. |
| `fgcz.scss`               | Theme overrides — tabset/card styling, figure rows.                                                                             |
| `fgcz_header_quarto.html` | FGCZ header, injected via `include-in-header`.                                                                                  |
| `template.qmd`            | Generic starter report demonstrating the tabset, figure+callout, and nesting patterns.                                          |

## How the styling attaches (no front-matter coupling)

Quarto automatically merges a file named `_metadata.yml` into every
`.qmd` in its directory and subdirectories. So a report carries **no**
`metadata-files` line and no path to this package — it stays a plain
`.qmd`. As long as the three files above sit in the same directory, a
bare

``` sh
quarto render CountQC.qmd
```

renders with full FGCZ styling **even if this package is not
installed**.

The `_metadata.yml` references `fgcz.scss` and `fgcz_header_quarto.html`
by bare filename, which Quarto resolves relative to the input `.qmd`, so
all three must travel together. The package’s only job is to *stage*
them next to a `.qmd` that lives elsewhere — that is what
[`fgcz_copy_assets()`](https://prolfqua.github.io/fgczquartotemplate/reference/fgcz_copy_assets.md)
/
[`fgcz_render()`](https://prolfqua.github.io/fgczquartotemplate/reference/fgcz_render.md)
do.

## Usage

Your report’s front matter is just its own params/title — nothing
FGCZ-specific:

``` yaml
---
params:
  reportTitle: "CountQC"
title: "`r params$reportTitle`"
---
```

Render it through the wrapper — the shared assets are staged
automatically:

``` r
fgczquartotemplate::fgcz_render(
  "CountQC.qmd",
  execute_params = list(reportTitle = "CountQC")
)
```

Bootstrap a brand-new report from the starter template:

``` r
fgczquartotemplate::fgcz_use_template("reports/my_analysis",
                                      to = "my_analysis.qmd")
# edit reports/my_analysis/my_analysis.qmd, then:
fgczquartotemplate::fgcz_render("reports/my_analysis/my_analysis.qmd")
```

Just need the paths (e.g. to stage assets yourself)?

``` r
fgczquartotemplate::fgcz_quarto_dir()             # the inst/quarto directory
fgczquartotemplate::fgcz_copy_assets("some/dir")  # stage the 3 styling files
```

## Using it from ezRun / prolfqua

1.  Add `fgczquartotemplate` to `Imports` in the consumer’s
    `DESCRIPTION`.

2.  Replace ad-hoc `quarto_render()` calls with
    [`fgczquartotemplate::fgcz_render()`](https://prolfqua.github.io/fgczquartotemplate/reference/fgcz_render.md).

3.  In the consumer, **git-ignore the staged copies** so the packaged
    assets remain the single source of truth — add to the render
    directory’s `.gitignore`:

        _metadata.yml
        fgcz.scss
        fgcz_header_quarto.html

App-specific reports (e.g. `CountQC.qmd`, `ScSeurat.qmd`) stay in their
own package; only the shared *styling* lives here.
