# Changelog

## fgczquartotemplate 0.1.0

- The opt-in toolbar’s **🔍 Find** panel now opens tabs through
  Bootstrap’s tab API so htmlwidgets such as DT tables redraw when
  revealed from inactive tabs.
- The opt-in toolbar’s **🔍 Find** panel now renders Plotly htmlwidgets
  as thumbnail cards by rasterizing the embedded widget JSON in the
  browser.
- The opt-in toolbar’s **🔍 Find** panel now uses Quarto figure captions
  for Plotly htmlwidgets inside figure floats instead of adding
  duplicate captionless Plotly cards.
- The opt-in toolbar’s **📥 Save** panel now excludes Plotly htmlwidgets
  inside figure floats from the static-download list.
- The opt-in toolbar’s **🔍 Find** panel now renders DT tables as table
  preview cards instead of generic figure placeholders.
- The opt-in toolbar’s **🔍 Find** button opens a graphical table of
  contents showing figures and tables, including content in inactive
  tabs; click one to jump to it. Results are grouped by their report
  location, and section/subsection/tab titles are included in filtering.
  Figure thumbnails reuse the report’s embedded images, so they work
  offline. The **📥 Save** panel also shows thumbnails for downloadable
  plots.
- The search + download toolbar is now **opt-in**.
  [`fgcz_render()`](https://prolfqua.github.io/fgczquartotemplate/reference/fgcz_render.md)
  gains a `buttons` argument (default `FALSE`); pass `buttons = TRUE` to
  add the right-edge 🔍 Find / 📥 Save toolbar. It is no longer wired
  into `_metadata.yml` or the Quarto extension by default; the extension
  and plain `quarto render` routes opt in with an `include-after-body:`
  line.
- [`fgcz_copy_assets()`](https://prolfqua.github.io/fgczquartotemplate/reference/fgcz_copy_assets.md)
  accepts either an existing directory or a `.qmd` file path.
