  Conventions for authoring FGCZ Quarto analysis reports with the
  fgczquartotemplate package: tab-depth rules, one-screen layout, small gridded
  figures with lightbox zoom, and when interactive (plotly/ggplotly) figures are
  worth it. Use this skill whenever writing, structuring, or reviewing a `.qmd`
  report that uses the FGCZ template (fgczquartotemplate, `_metadata.yml`, or
  `format: fgczquartotemplate-html`), deciding how to lay out tabs and figures
  in an FGCZ / SUSHI report, or turning an analysis (ezRun, prolfqua,
  prolfquapp, DIA-NN, single-cell) into an FGCZ-styled HTML report — even if the
  user never names the template explicitly.

# Authoring FGCZ Quarto reports

This skill is about **how to structure a report** — the layout and content
decisions that make an FGCZ report readable. For *setting up* the template
(installing / wiring it), see the package `README.md`. Here we assume the
styling is already attached and focus on the choices that are easy to get wrong.

The golden rule behind everything below: **a reader should understand each tab
at a glance and navigate by clicking, not by scrolling and hunting.**

## Using the template: two ways (pick one)

The package ships the same FGCZ styling through two channels — both produce an
identical report, so choose by *how you render*. Full setup details live in the
package `README.md`; this is the short version.

**Way 1 — Quarto extension (render with the `quarto` CLI, no R).**
Install once per project, then opt in from the header:
```sh
quarto add prolfqua/fgczquartotemplate
```
```yaml
---
title: "My report"
format: fgczquartotemplate-html
---
```
Render with plain `quarto render my_report.qmd`.

**Way 2 — R helper (render from R, e.g. inside a package like prolfquapp).**
Install once (`remotes::install_github("prolfqua/fgczquartotemplate")`), keep the
report header free of any `format:` line, and render with:
```r
fgczquartotemplate::fgcz_render("my_report.qmd")
```
It stages `_metadata.yml` (plus the theme, header, and toolbar files) next to the
`.qmd`, and Quarto applies `_metadata.yml` automatically — no `format:` line and
no `quarto add`. Companion helpers: `fgcz_use_template()` starts a new report
from the annotated starter, `fgcz_copy_assets()` just stages the files, and
`fgcz_quarto_dir()` points at the installed assets.

Either way you get the theme and the FGCZ header for free. The right-edge
**🔍 Find / 🖼️ Figures / 📥 Save** toolbar is opt-in — turn it on with
`fgcz_render(buttons = TRUE)` (or an `include-after-body:` line for the CLI
routes); see the last section. Start from `inst/quarto/template.qmd` (via
`fgcz_use_template()`), which demonstrates every layout pattern below in code.

## Tabs: keep them shallow

Organize the report with `::: {.panel-tabset}`. Depth is the single most common
mistake, so be deliberate:

- **Two tab levels is the norm.** Top-level tabs = major sections; one level of
  sub-tabs inside them is plenty for almost every report.
- **A third level is the exception**, allowed only when the third-level tabs are
  the **same across every second-level tab** — i.e. the nesting forms a clean
  matrix (pick a category, then pick a view).

  Good (third level is uniform → nest it):
  ```
  Method A → { Overview, Details }
  Method B → { Overview, Details }
  ```
  Not OK (third level diverges → do NOT nest):
  ```
  Method A → { Overview, Details }
  Method C → { Foo, Bar }          ← different sub-tabs
  ```
  When one branch's sub-tabs differ, that branch is really its own section:
  **promote it to a top-level tab** rather than forcing an inconsistent third
  level. Uniform sub-tabs read as "same views for each thing"; divergent ones
  hide structure and confuse the reader.

Note: `template.qmd` deliberately demonstrates nesting up to five levels — that
is a *capability* demo showing the mechanics render correctly, **not** a
recommendation. Real reports stay at two levels, occasionally three.

## Fit each tab on one screen

Aim for a tab's content to fit on screen **without vertical scrolling**. The
reader should take in a tab at a glance and switch tabs for more, rather than
scroll and search.

The one honest exception is **the same figure repeated per sample or
condition** — e.g. a TIC chromatogram shown separately for samples A, B, C,
stacked vertically. Repetition-by-sample stays legible when scrolled because the
reader knows exactly what each item is. Stacking *unrelated* content to fill a
long page does not — split that across tabs instead.

## Figures: small and gridded

- **Don't make figures large.** Every figure is click-to-zoom (lightbox is on by
  default), so a compact on-page figure plus zoom-on-click beats a giant inline
  one — and it lets more fit on a screen.
- **Lay figures out in a grid** so several share a screen. Use Quarto's layout:
  ```
  #| layout-ncol: 2
  ```
  inside a chunk (or `::: {layout-ncol="2"}` around several figures). The
  template also provides `.fig-row` / `.fig-main` / `.fig-side` for a figure
  with a side callout.
- **Always give a figure a `#| fig-cap:`.** Captions are what the Find toolbar
  indexes and what makes cross-references work.

## Interactive figures are the exception

Default to **static** figures (`ggplot`). They are lighter, print cleanly, and —
importantly — the 📥 Save toolbar (when enabled) can bundle them into a ZIP;
interactive `plotly` / `ggplotly` charts cannot be downloaded that way.

Reach for `ggplotly()` **only when interactivity genuinely improves
readability**, for example:

- a legend too large to fit on the plot (let the reader hover instead), or
- many overlapping lines in similar colours (e.g. density overlays) where
  hover/zoom is the only way to disentangle them.

If a static figure reads fine, keep it static.

## The Find / Figures / Save toolbar: opt-in, and don't hand-build it

The template ships a right-edge toolbar with three tools — **🔍 Find**
(searchable list of every figure and table; clicking one opens the tab it lives
in and scrolls to it), **🖼️ Figures** (a graphical table of contents: a
thumbnail per figure, click to jump to it), and **📥 Save** (tick-box download
of the static plots as a single ZIP). It is **off by default**; switch it on
with `fgcz_render(buttons = TRUE)` (or an `include-after-body:
…/fgcz-plot-finder.html` line for the extension / plain `quarto render` routes).
When you want it, use that switch — never hand-add buttons, a table-of-figures,
or a thumbnail gallery; the template's version is complete and tested.

Because the finder indexes figures and tables by their **caption** and their
**tab breadcrumb**, the same two habits that make a report readable also make
the finder and the figure gallery useful: give every figure/table a clear `fig-cap` / caption, and give
tabs meaningful labels.

## Quick checklist before you ship

- [ ] Two tab levels (a third only if its sub-tabs are identical across siblings)
- [ ] Each tab fits on a screen (scroll only for the same figure repeated per sample)
- [ ] Figures small and gridded (`layout-ncol`), each with a `fig-cap`
- [ ] Static figures unless interactivity is truly needed for readability
- [ ] Toolbar via `buttons = TRUE` (or `include-after-body`) if wanted — never hand-built

## Pointers

- `README.md` — installing / wiring the template (the two usage models)
- `inst/quarto/template.qmd` — worked examples of every pattern above
- `_metadata.yml` / `_extensions/fgczquartotemplate/_extension.yml` — the format options
